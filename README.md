Time-Harmonic-Elastography
=========================

Overview
--------
***Time-Harmonic-Elastography*** is a Matlab toolbox for time-harmonic optical flow.
It implements reconstruction algorithms and simulation of synthetic data for time-harmonic optical flow.

__Reconstruction Methods__
* Least squares solver for L_2^2 data fidelity and L_2^2 regularizer
* Iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm for L_1 data fidelity and L_1 regularizer
* Iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm for L_1 data fidelity and L_2^2 regularizer 
* Adoption of Matlab Horn-Schunk implementation and primal-dual hybrid gradient method for time-harmonic optical flow
